            Among us is a 2018 online social deduction game developed by Innersloth. its core gameplay is 
            similar to mafia(werewolf). The game first released on IOS and Android devices during june 2018 
            and on Windows later in november. The game is space themed with colourful cartoon styled 
            astronauts, each players has two roles; imposter and crewmates. There is a higher number 
            of crewmates than imposters; the numbers of imposters can vary, depending on the host's settings within the game. There can be 1 - 3 imposters at a time.
            Among us can be played with 4-15 players; I personally recommend a game with 6 players or more 
            for it to be interesting. There are currently 4 maps; "The skeld, Mira hq, Polus, Airship" and 
            an upcoming <A href="https://among-us.fandom.com/wiki/Map_5" style="color: white;"> map 5?</A> and each map has differenting <a href="#locations" style="color: white;">Locations</a>

        <p class="paragraph" id="maps">
            <sus class="minititle">Maps</sus>
            
            Maps is one of the mechanic of the game, it makes up the environment that players interact with. the maps are chosen by the host before the game starts, each maps contain different tasks
            Each map has different places and hallways connecting the places, each place usually has at 
            least one task. The skeld is the first map added to among us, which was released during june 15 2018. The map is second smallest in the whole game.

            locations are parts of maps to do tasks or use certain abilities
